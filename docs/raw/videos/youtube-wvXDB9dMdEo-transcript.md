00:21 JAKE XIA: This is the second
time we are having this class. We had it last year
in a smaller version.

00:27 That was for six
units of a credit, and we had it once a week. And mostly practitioners
from the industry,

00:36 from Morgan Stanley,
talking about examples how math is applied
in modern finance.

00:48 And so we got some good
response last year. So, with the support
of the math department,

00:53 we decided to expand this
class to be 12 units of credit

00:58 and have twice a week. So, we have every Tuesday
and Thursday afternoon from 2:30 to 4:00, as you
know, in this classroom.

01:05 So last year, Dr. Vasily
Strela and I-- by the way,

01:13 I'm Jake Xia and
that's Dr. Vasily, and we were the main
instructors last year.

01:18 Now we doubled it up to
four main instructors. That's Dr. Peter Kempthorne
and Dr. Choongbum Lee.

01:26 The reason we doubled
up the main instructors is we have newly added math
lectures, mostly focusing

01:35 from linear algebra,
probability to statistics, and some stochastic calculus
to give you the foundation

01:42 to understand the
math will be used in those examples in the lecture
taught by the practitioners

01:52 from the industry. And the purpose of
this course is really to give you a sampling menu to
see how mathematics is applied

02:02 in modern finance and help you
to decide if this is a field that you would be-- RECORDED VOICE: Thank
you, for using WebEx.

02:08 Please visit our website
at www.webex.com.

02:14 JAKE XIA: OK, you heard that. And so hopefully, this will
give you enough information

02:21 to decide this is a field
you would like to pursue in your future career. In fact, last year when
we finished the class,

02:29 we had a few students coming
to work in the industry. Some work at Morgan Stanley,
some work at elsewhere.

02:35 So that's really the goal. And at the same
time, obviously, you

02:43 will further solidify
your math knowledge and learn new content.

02:51 And we put the prerequisite
about the math part a bit later.

02:56 So I will use today's
first lecture's time to give you an
introduction, really,

03:02 to prepare you some basic
background knowledge about the financial markets.

03:08 Some terminologies
will be used, which you may not have heard before.

03:13 So before I get into
the introduction, I always like to know who are
actually in the classroom,

03:19 so let me ask you
a few questions. You just need to
raise your hands so I know roughly what kind of
background and where you are.

03:28 So how many undergraduate
students are here?

03:33 So I would say 80% percent.

03:38 How many graduate students
are here, just to verify? Yep, that's about right, 20%.

03:44 And how many students are in
finance and business major?

03:51 Just one. And how many of you
are a math major?

03:56 Most of you. How many of you are
engineering majors?

04:02 A few. How many of you actually
are from other universities?

04:08 Great, because last
year we had quite a few, so I want to
specifically tell you that you're very welcome
to attend the classes here.

04:17 So it's open door. And last year I remember
we had a couple of students

04:22 from Harvard. That's where I actually
work right now.

04:29 I forgot to mention
that, but I'm affiliated with both the math
department and the Sloan school

04:35 here. So anyway, thanks for that. We will be doing a bit
more polling along the way,

04:41 mainly to get feedback of
how you feel about the class. Last year we had it
online, so if you

04:48 feel the class is
going too fast, or the math part
is going too slow, or the finance part
is a bit confusing,

04:55 the easiest way is
really just to send us emails, which you will find
from the class website.

05:02 So anyway, today-- VASILY STRELA: And all
of us got MIT emails. JAKE XIA: Yes. We all have MIT emails, which
are listed on the website.

05:10 VASILY STRELA: [INAUDIBLE].  JAKE XIA: And obviously,
we have offices here.

05:17 You can easily stop by Peter
and Choongbum's offices. And Vasily and I probably
will be less often on campus,

05:26 but we'll be here quite often
and definitely love to be more. So anyway, I will start
today's lecture with a story,

05:35 and a quiz at the end. Don't worry, it's
not a real quiz. Just going to ask
you some questions

05:40 you can raise your hand
and give your answer. But let me start with my story.

05:46 This is actually
my personal story. I want to tell you why
I tell the story later.

05:52 But the story actually
was in the mid '90s. I just left Salomon Brothers
-- that was my first financial

06:01 industry job -- to go to Morgan
Stanley in New York to join

06:06 the options trading desk. So the first day, I sat down,
I opened the trading book,

06:15 I found something was missing. So, I turned around,
I asked my desk quant.

06:22 I said, where is
the vega report? So, let me show you.

06:27 So that's the story.

06:33 So I'm obviously not going
to tell you the story of Pi

06:39 or "Life of Pi." That's not a financial story. The rest of the story,
alpha, beta, delta, gamma,

06:45 theta, which you will learn
from Peter and Choongbum and Vasily's classes.

06:50 So I'm going to talk about vega. So by the way, before
I tell you the story, what's unique about
vega on this list?

06:57 AUDIENCE: It's not
a Greek letter. JAKE XIA: It's not
a Greek letter. That's right. So I turned around and
asked my desk quant, I said,

07:04 where's the vega report? But how many of you actually
know what a vega is?

07:09 OK, lot of people know. So anyway, I'm not
going to-- just for the people who haven't
heard about it before, it's

07:16 a measurement about
a book or portfolio or position's sensitivity
to volatility.

07:22 So, what is volatility? Which again, you will learn
more in rigorous terms

07:29 how it's defined in mathematics. But the meaning of it is really
a measurement or indication

07:36 of how volatile, or what's the
standard deviation of a price can change over time.

07:43 That's all you need
to know right now. I'm not going to ask
you questions later. So my desk quant
look at me, said--

07:52 this is supposed to
be options trading desk, so he look at me puzzled.

07:58 So instead of
answering my question, he handed over me
a training manual for new employees
and new analysts.

08:06 So I opened the training
manual and looked it through. I actually found my answer.

08:12 So actually, at Morgan Stanley
this is not called vega, it's called kappa.

08:17 So now, I remember
to call it kappa. Kappa is actually
a Greek letter. So further, I look
on the same page

08:25 there was actually a
footnote, which I copied down. So the footnote about why it's
called kappa at Morgan Stanley.

08:39 Kappa is also called vega
by some uneducated traders at the Salomon Brothers.

08:45 That's where I came from. I just joined. They have mistaken
vega as a Greek letter

08:50 after gambling at Vegas.  So anyway, so that
was my first day.

08:58 So obviously, I learned
how to call kappa very quickly, because I
came from Salomon Brothers.

09:05 And I called it kappa
in the last 17 years, but you will hear
people calling it vega.

09:12 Obviously, I have probably more
people calling it the vega. But anyway, so that's my
first day at Morgan Stanley.

09:19 But why did I tell
you the story? What point I try to make?

09:24 So this story is actually--
when you think about it, mathematical or quantitative
finance is a rather new field.

09:33 A lot of these terms
were newly introduced. And the pricing model
of options, as you know,

09:42 was introduced in the
Black-Scholes in the '70s, or some of the ground work
may be done a bit earlier.

09:49 But it's not like finance
was a quantitative profession

09:55 to start with. So what we witness
in the last 30 years was really a transformation of
the trading profession coming

10:04 from mostly
under-educated traders. Some of them typically joined
the firms in the mail room

10:13 and became trader later on. That's typical career path. And to nowadays, if you
walk on the trading floor,

10:20 you talk to the traders, most
of them have advanced degrees and quite a few of them
have very high training

10:29 in mathematics and
computer science. So what has changed over
the last 20 or 30 years?

10:36 I myself, personally, was
probably one of the data point experiencing this change.

10:44 And I certainly
didn't expect I would be doing this when
I was at MIT, but I

10:51 did that in the last 20 years. So the point I'm
trying to tell you

10:59 is, before you dive into
any details of mathematics

11:04 or any concept in finance in
this class, just bear in mind,

11:11 this is a field developed in the
last mostly 30 years, or even

11:16 shorter. And what you really
need to ask questions is-- it's not really is it
right or wrong in mathematics,

11:26 is it right or wrong in physics? So, how the concepts
are established

11:31 and defined and verified. Because this is a field--
the transformation

11:37 about the participants,
products, models, methodology,

11:42 everything are
changing very rapidly. Even nowadays, they're
still changing. So with that, I will
give you some background

11:51 on how the financial
markets actually started,

11:57 and that's really the history
part of this industry.

12:03 So, when we talk about
markets, we know in early days people need to exchange goods.

12:10 You have something
I don't have, I have something you don't
have, so there's exchanges.

12:15 Then it becomes centralized. There are stock exchanges,
futures exchanges all over the world where
these products will

12:22 be listed as securities
on these exchanges. That's one way of trading,
which is centralized.

12:30 Obviously, in the
last 10, 15 years, now we have ECNs,
electronic platforms.

12:37 Trade over-- you know, even
larger volume of those trades. So, financial products is
really just one form of trading.

12:47 There are many other ways of
trading aside from exchanges. One of them, which
is called OTC,

12:55 is over-the-counter, meaning
two counterparties agree to do a trade without really
subject to the exchange rules,

13:05 or the underlying trading
agreement does not have to be a securitized
product, or standardized,

13:13 or whatever ways you define it. And the different regions
have different exchanges

13:18 and markets, as well. And they typically specialize
in local products, local company

13:25 stocks, local bonds,
and local currencies.

13:31 So, there are many
different forms. So again, what's in common?

13:37 That's the question
you need to ask. Also, you don't
know the specifics. And the currencies, money
itself, are also traded.

13:47 And that's where
different currencies issued by different countries.

13:52 So, when we talk
about trading stocks-- there are also people
trade baskets of stocks,

13:57 trade groups of stocks
together, and that's stock index or indices.

14:03 So, there are
different products. How the stock get listed
on the stock exchange?

14:09 It goes through IPO-- Initial
Public Offering process. So, when a company changes
from private to public,

14:17 it goes through
this IPO process. It's called primary
market, primary listing.

14:23 And once the stock is
listed on the exchange

14:28 and it becomes
traded in the market, we call it secondary trading. So, that's after
the primary market.

14:36 And equity or stock
is one form of trading or one form of
financial products.

14:43 What are other forms? Loans. Actually, debt products are more
generic than equity products.

14:52 When you started
thinking about it, what is really finance is about?

14:57 It's really about someone
has money, someone doesn't. Someone has money to lend out,
someone needs to borrow money.

15:05 So, that's loan. Loan is really a
private agreement between two counterparties
or multiple counterparties.

15:13 When you securitize
them, they become bonds. And when you look at
bonds, every government

15:20 will issue large sovereign debt. So, US government has large
outstanding US Treasury debt--

15:27 bonds, notes, bills. And corporates have issued a
lot of debt product, as well.

15:34 They borrow money when they
need to build a new factory or expand. Universities borrow money.

15:41 When MIT needs to build a new
building, some of the money will come from the
endowment support,

15:47 some will come from some
other form of research budget, or some will come
from debt financing.

15:55 Just borrow from the
public-- local governments, states, counties, even.

16:01 So, they have various forms. So, that's debt product. Commodities, actually, you know.

16:10 Metal, energy,
agriculture products are traded, mostly
in the futures

16:15 format and some in
physical format, meaning you take deliveries. When you actually
buying and sell,

16:21 you build a warehouse
to take them. You ship a tank to
store above the ocean.

16:29 And the real estate, you're
buying and sell houses. 2008 financial crisis,
if you read about it,

16:36 this has a lot to do
with the real estate market, the mortgages, and
asset-backed securities.

16:44 So, I'm not trying to give
you all the definition, dumping the information on you. But I like you at least
hearing it once today,

16:52 and then you have more interest,
you can read on the side. So asset-backed securities
is when you have an asset,

17:00 you basically issue a debt
with the asset backing it.

17:06 And how do you rate
the asset's risk level and what's the income
stream, cash flow?

17:14 And before 2008
financial crisis, as you heard, large amount
of CMBS-- basically,

17:25 it's a commercial
real estate backed securities, mortgage securities,
and the residential, as well.

17:33 And further of all of these,
you heard probably a lot about the derivative products.

17:39 So, that started
with swaps, options. And the structure
of the products, it

17:44 become more tailor-made for
either investors or borrowers

17:51 to structure the products in
a way to suit their needs. And some of the complexity
of those structured products

17:59 become quite high,
and the mathematics involved in pricing them
and the risk management

18:05 become rather challenging.

18:14 So coming back to the
players in the market,

18:23 one large type of
player is really bank.

18:29 Essentially, after 1933
Glass-Steagall legislation,

18:34 there were two main
types of banks. One is called commercial bank,
the other is investment bank.

18:40 Commercial bank is
supposedly, you're taking deposits and
lend out the money,

18:46 and doing more
commercial services. Investment bank supposed to
focus on the capital markets,

18:55 raising capital, trading,
and asset management.

19:00 But obviously, after 1999, the
Glass-Steagall was repealed.

19:08 There's no longer that. Some people blame
that, and probably for a very good reason, for the
cause of 2008 financial crisis.

19:18 But I want to tell you how
currently investment banks are organized.

19:23 Vasily just mentioned he
works in the fixed income.

19:31 So banks typically organized
by institutional business and asset management.

19:37 So, within the institutional
client business, it has typically
three main parts.

19:43 Fixed income, which
trade the debt and the derivative products.

19:48 Equity, trade stocks and
the derivative products. And IBD, stands for
Investment Banking Division,

19:57 which really covers
corporate finance, raising capital, listing
a stock, IPO, and merger

20:05 and acquisition, and advisory. So that's how banks
are organized.

20:11 Outside banks, other players,
basically, the asset managers, are obviously a very big force
in the financial markets.

20:19 So the question a
lot of people ask is, is this a zero sum game?

20:27 I'm sure you've heard
this many times. So, in the financial
markets, some people win,

20:32 some people lose. A lot of times, it depends
on the specific products you

20:38 trade, the market you're in. It is, lot of times,
pretty net zero.

20:44 But why do we need
financial markets? This comes back to what
I described before.

20:53 Because something
existed-- actually, there's a need for it. It's really the need to
bridge between the lenders

21:02 and the borrowers. That's really coming down to
the essential relationship.

21:07 So, investors who
have money need to have better yield or better
return, better interest.

21:14 In the current environment,
when you have a savings account, you don't really
earn much at all.

21:21 And so you would have to take
more risk to generate more

21:26 return, or you
have longer horizon CDs, other type of products,
or trade the stocks.

21:34 So, when somebody has money,
when you trade stocks, you're essentially--
you're buying a stock,

21:41 you give the money somewhere. Supposedly, it will
go to the company. Company use the money to
generate a better return.

21:50 And for the borrowers,
whoever needs money, they need to have
access to the capital.

21:58 So obviously, different
borrowers have different risks. Some people borrow
money, never return.

22:04 So, never generate any
returns, or never even return the principal. And so the trade between
lenders and the borrowers,

22:12 is again, essentially
the main driver of the financial markets.

22:20 So, a few more words about
the market participants. So, banks and so-called dealers
play the role of market making.

22:30 What is market making? So, when you or some end
user go to the market,

22:36 wants to buy or sell,
typically, if there's no market, you don't really find the match.

22:43 And some of the products
you want to buy or sell may not necessarily be liquid.

22:48 So, the dealers step in the
middle, make you a price. Say, OK, you want
to buy or sell.

22:55 I can tell you-- this
stock, I make you price.

23:00 $0.99, and that's my bid.
$0.95, that's my offer.

23:08 So, that's the price I'm
willing to buy or sell. But what the result of
the trade-- the dealer

23:15 actually takes the other
side of your trade. So, they take principal
risk, in this case.

23:21 So, that's the difference
between dealers and the brokers. So, brokers don't really
take principal risks.

23:28 If you want to buy
something or sell something, if I'm a broker, I
don't make you a price.

23:34 I go to the market makers. I actually put two
people together,

23:40 matchmaking, make
that trade happen. So, I earn the commission. So, that's a broker's role.

23:47 So obviously, there are
individual investors, retail investors, same meaning.

23:52 Mutual funds, who actually
manage public investors' money,

23:57 typically in the
long-only format. Long means you buy something.

24:04 So, you don't really short
sell a particular security.

24:09 Insurance companies
has large asset. They need to generate a
return, generate cash flow to meet their liability needs.

24:17 So, they need to invest. And the pension
funds, same thing. As inflation goes
higher, they need

24:22 to pay out more to the retirees,
so where do you get the return? Sovereign wealth fund,
similarly, endowment

24:29 funds-- they all have
this same situation, have capital and needs to deploy
and to make better return.

24:36 So this other type of
players, hedge funds. So, how many of you
have heard hedge funds?

24:45 OK, good. Almost everyone. And Peter mentioned that he
used to work at a hedge fund.

24:51 And so, there are
different types of strategies, which I
will dive into a bit more,

24:58 but hedge fund play the role
in the market-- they basically find opportunities to profit
from inefficient market

25:08 positioning or pricing, so
they have different strategies. And the private equity is
different type of funds.

25:16 They basically look
to invest in companies

25:22 and either take them private or
invest in a private equity form

25:29 to hopefully improve the
company's profitability, and then catch up.

25:35 And governments obviously have
a huge impact on the market. So, we know in the financial
crisis, government intervened.

25:45 And not only that, at the
normal market condition, government always have a very
large impact on the market,

25:52 because they are
the policymakers. They decide the interest
rate and interest rate curve.

25:57 And the different policies
they push out, obviously, will generate different
outlook for the future markets,

26:05 therefore, profitability. Then the corporate hedges
and the liabilities. When corporates borrow
money, they create some risk,

26:13 so they need to be sensitive
to the market, it changes.

26:20 So, to summarize the
types of trading. The first type is
really just hedging.

26:28 That means you're
not proactively adding risk to what you have. You already have some exposure.

26:34 Just give you an example. Let's say you borrow
money, you bought a house,

26:41 so you have mortgage. So, let's say it's a floating
rate mortgage payments.

26:51 And you're worried about
interest rates going higher, so you can lock that rate in
into the fixed rate format.

26:59 Or you can find ways
to hedge your exposure. Or your corporate has a large
income coming from Europe.

27:09 So, you have euros coming
in, but you're not sure if euro would trade stronger
to the US dollar in the future,

27:17 or trade weaker. If you think it will be
stronger, you just leave it. But if you think it
will trade weaker,

27:25 so you may want to
hedge it, meaning you want to sell euro
and buy US dollars.

27:30 And so that's the hedging type. The second type, as I
mentioned, is a market maker. So, market maker also
takes principal risk,

27:38 but the main source of profit
is really to earn the bid offer.

27:44 I gave you the example
$0.90 bid, $0.95 offer. So, that's what the market
maker is trying to profit from.

27:53 But obviously, they
have residual risks sitting on the book. Not every trade is matched.

27:59 So, how to optimize
those group of trades, that's what market
maker is doing.

28:06 Most of the bank's
dealers are market makers. In the new regulation,
obviously, proprietary trading

28:14 is banned, right? And so the third type is
really the proprietary trader,

28:21 the risk taker. So, these are the hedge funds
or some portfolio managers.

28:27 They need to focus on generating
return and control the risk.

28:33 So, that's where the beta and
alpha, the concept comes in. So, if you're a portfolio
manager, some people say,

28:41 don't worry. Don't go pick any stocks. Just buy S&P 500 index fund. Very cheap.

28:47 You can pay very
little cost to do it. That's true. But if you want to
beat the S&P 500

28:55 index-- let's assume we call
S&P 500 index fund is asset b.

29:03 So, the return of that, R(b). That's a return of that index. Now, you have a portfolio a.

29:11 Your time series of
return of your asset a, obviously, you can
do linear regression.

29:18 A lot of you are
math major here, and you can find a correlation
between those two time series.

29:26 So, how the two returns are
related in a simplified form. So you can say, this
actually-- somehow it came out.

29:35 It's supposed to
be alpha and beta, but it turned out
to be the letters.

29:41 So, in a short description,
beta is really-- just think as correlated move
with the other asset.

29:50 Alpha is really the
difference in the return.

29:56 It's a format. You want to beat S&P 500,
so you want to basically have certain tracking
of this index,

30:02 but you want to return
more on top of that.

30:10 So let me just go
in bit of details of how each type of
trade actually occurs.

30:18 So, when we talk
about hedging, I mentioned the currency example. Let me give you another example.

30:23 There are a lot of people
issue bonds, or issue debt. So this example I'm
going to give you is,

30:29 let's think about
Australian corporate. Because interest
rate in Australia

30:36 is higher than in
Japan, so typically, people like to borrow
money in Japan, because you

30:44 pay smaller interest. And they invest it in Australia. You earn higher interest rate.

30:54 So let me ask you a question. Who can tell me,
why don't people just do that all day long,
just borrow from Japan

31:02 and invest it in Australia? Then that interest
rate, I'm giving you

31:08 example of a difference is about
3.5% for the roughly 10 year

31:15 swap rates. Yeah, go ahead. AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]. JAKE XIA: Right.

31:21 Because you invest
in the Australia Ozzie, Australian dollar. The Australian dollar may
become weaker to the yen.

31:27 You may lose all your
profit, or even more. And further, if everybody
plays the same game, then

31:35 when you try to exit, you
have the adverse impact of your trade.

31:41 So, let's say you think that's
the right time to do it, but then at one
time, you wake up,

31:47 you said, huh, I think too
many people are doing this. I want to hedge myself. So, what do you do? AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

31:52 JAKE XIA: Yep. So, you try to lock in, right? So basically, you sell
the Australian dollars,

32:00 buy the Japanese yen. Or on the interest
rate terms, you say you'll basically pay the
Australian dollar in the swap

32:09 leg, and receive yen.  This involves foreign exchange
trade, interest rate swap,

32:19 and the cross-currency swap. So, your answer about currency
forward is roughly right,

32:26 but obviously involves a bit
more in actual execution.

32:31 So that's just to
give you example. Even if you are
not a finance guy, you work in a corporate, you
just do you import, export,

32:39 or building a factory, you
have to know, actually, what the exposure is.

32:44 So, risk management, nowadays,
becomes pretty widespread responsibility.

32:50 It's not just the corporate
treasury's responsibility.

32:55 So, that's on the hedging side. Obviously, if you are
Intel, for example,

33:01 you sell a lot of
chips overseas. And your income--
actually, Intel does

33:07 have lot of overseas income
sitting outside the States. So, the exposure to them is if
the exchange rate fluctuates,

33:16 dollar becomes a lot stronger,
they actually lose money. So, they need to think about how
to hedge the revenue produced

33:24 overseas. And obviously, for
import-exporters,

33:30 that's even more apparent. And if you're entering
in a merger deal,

33:36 and one company
is buying another, you need to hedge your
potential currency

33:41 exposure and your
interest rate exposure. And whatever is on the
assets, or the liability,

33:48 or the balance sheet, you
need to hedge your exposure.

33:56 So we talked about
hedging activity. Let's talk about market making.

34:01 So if it's a simple
transparent product, everybody pretty much
knows where the price is.

34:07 So, if you buy Apple stock,
I think a lot of people know pretty much where it is. You may even have it
on your cellphone,

34:15 know where that stock is. But if it's not transparent,
so what do you do?

34:21 So, if instead of asking
you where Apple is, probably you're going
to tell me $495 today. AUDIENCE: I don't really know.

34:27 JAKE XIA: OK. But if I asked you instead,
what is the call option on Apple stock in
two month's time?

34:37 I'll give you a
strike, let's say, 500. So you're probably
less transparent. So that market maker comes
in to provide that liquidity,

34:46 and then takes the risk. They manage the book by
balancing those Greeks, which

34:52 I mentioned earlier. Delta, which describes the
[INAUDIBLE] relationship

34:59 of this whole book to the
underlying stock, or underlying whatever currency. That's called delta.

35:05 Gamma is really the
change of the portfolio.

35:11 Take the derivative
to the delta, or to the underlying spot.

35:16 So, that's second-order
derivative. Delta is the first order. So gamma, now you have curvature
or convexity coming in.

35:27 And theta is really-- nothing
changes in the market. Nothing changes
in your position.

35:34 How your trading book is
carrying or bleeding away

35:39 money. And we talk about the
volatility exposure was vega. And on top of that,
what are the tail risks?

35:47 What are the events can actually
get you into big trouble? So people use value at risk.

35:54 So you will hear
this "VaR" concept in some of the lectures,
which is also, obviously,

35:59 a very important concept. I think Peter will-- or
Choongbum will-- probably Peter will teach.

36:06 Then capital. How much capital are you using? It becomes a very
important issue nowadays.

36:13 And balance sheet. Again, you have asset,
you have liability. How do you leverage?

36:19 How much leverage you have? Before the crisis, for example,
lot of the banks leverage up 40 times, meaning when you
have $1, you had $40 exposure.

36:29 So when the market moves
little, you get wiped out. That's really what amplified
in the 2008 financial crisis.

36:36 And how do you measure
the asset in balance sheet when you have derivatives
rather than a straightforward

36:43 notional?

36:50 So lot of quantitative
type of people like to focus a bit more
on the risk taking side,

36:56 because people heard stories
about successful cases of some hedge funds
using high math.

37:03 They generated very
impressive returns and they seem to have an edge.

37:09 So now, people focus
on trading strategies. So that falls into the category
of proprietary trading or risk

37:17 taking. So that you can just simply
doing directional trading strategies. Just go long or short the stock.

37:24 That's very simple. Those so-called the gut
traders, gut feeling.

37:29 Go with your gut. You don't even think. You say, I'm eating curry
today, so I go long.

37:38 I'm eating rice
tomorrow, so I go short. So, this arbitrage.

37:44 Arbitrage is really to find the
relationships between prices,

37:50 and try to profit from those
relationship mispricing.

37:56 This is actually
very interesting. Not many people
focus on arbitrage,

38:01 because lot of people
are gut traders. You essentially just
watch your own market. You don't really
care what's going on.

38:07 If you trade gold in the
States, the gold price

38:13 happen in Asia and in
Europe matters, right, because you're trading
the same thing.

38:18 If they are not
priced the same way, you can profit from
the difference. And that's just
a simple example.

38:25 But a spot price versus
forward price, that's a deterministic relationship.

38:31 It's a mathematical
relationship. If that relationship breaks
down, you can also profit. So there are many examples
mathematical relationship

38:40 which gives you the
arbitrage opportunity. The other type is called a
value trader, or relative

38:47 value strategies.  Think there's a deterministic,
temporary mathematical

38:55 relationship. You look at the longer
term in horizon, trying to determine what
is really the underlying

39:01 value of a particular
instrument, then trade on the
relative value.

39:06 Obviously, there are successful
value investors out there. And the systematic trader
builds computer models.

39:15 One example is trend following,
so just follow the price trend. That used to be an effective
strategy for some time,

39:25 but when lot of people
doing the same thing, that becomes much less effective.

39:31 Or momentum, same thing. Stat arb, finding
statistical relationship

39:38 among large number
of stocks, then trade at the higher frequency.

39:46 And fundamental
analysis, you're really trying to understand what's
going on in the world. What is the trade balance?

39:54 What is the earning
potential of a company? What's the trade
balance of a country?

40:00 What is a policy change? What does it mean
when Federal Reserve announce they're going to
taper the quantitative easing?

40:08 Why the stock market is sold
off in the last couple months, especially why stocks in
India, Brazil, Indonesia,

40:17 sold out more. Why is that? So it goes through those
fundamental analysis.

40:22 And there are
special situations. Some companies are going
through particular difficulties,

40:31 assets are priced very cheaply. So, there are firms out there --
you probably heard Bain Capital

40:39 and many others -- where they
focus on these private equity and special situation
opportunities.

40:45 So what have all of these
to do with mathematics?

40:55 Where does math come in? How do you use math? So, I want to give you
some aspects of that.

41:02 So from my personal experience,
I joined the market, really start to working
on pricing models.

41:09 So, that's the first area. So, math is very
effective, because when you, your bank,
your corporate, you

41:19 want to buy some
financial instruments, you have to know
where is the price.

41:25 It's easy to observe
a stock in the market, but when it comes to
more complex products,

41:31 they just take one step
forward on the complexity, which is the option.

41:36 You have to know how
to price an option. So, that's where
the math comes in. You actually have to be able
to solve differential equations

41:43 to get a model price,
then you obviously adjust to your assumptions
to fit into the market.

41:51 So, pricing model, which Vasily
and many of his colleagues

41:57 can tell you more--
which is very much a very interesting
and challenging area.

42:03 How do you price all
these instruments? And when I say pricing, it's
not in the narrow definition

42:09 of just coming up
with the price. When you build a
pricing model, you also generate the risk parameters
of these instruments,

42:18 and how do you risk manage them. So, that comes to
the second part. So math is very useful
in risk management,

42:26 which I will give you
some -- not quiz -- questions after this slide.

42:31 You can see that risk management
itself is very challenging. It's not a purely
mathematical question,

42:37 but yet, math plays
a very important role to quantify how much
exposure you have.

42:44 Then, the third is
trading strategies. Again, I think a lot of
people with math background,

42:50 or in general,
people are looking for the so-called holy
grail trading strategies.

42:57 It's almost like perpetual
motion machines people looking for 100 years ago. You just turn it on.

43:03 It makes money by itself. You go to sleep, you go on
vacation, you come back, you'll have more in
your bank account.

43:10 Obviously, that's
not going to happen. The robotrader, a robotic
trader, is a dream.

43:20 It has its place or its use,
but it's a fast evolving market.

43:26 You have to constantly
either upgrade your research

43:31 and adjust your strategies. There's no such thing you
can build and leave it alone,

43:38 it runs for itself forever. But I just want to
mention that because maybe

43:45 towards the end of the
term you will feel, hmm, I came up with this
brilliant trading strategy.

43:50 I think it's going to
make money forever. Please let me know first.

43:55 AUDIENCE: And me second. PROFESSOR: So, I want to
leave some time to Vasily.

44:04 Actually, he can give
you some examples of projects of last
year's students

44:10 who actually came to this class
and did some real application

44:16 at Morgan Stanley. But before I hand
it over to Vasily, let me ask you some questions.

44:22 I just want to-- not really
to quiz you, just give you the sense how math and
intuition and judgment

44:30 can come into the same place. So, let me first give you an
example I call risk aversion.

44:35 So, you are facing two choices,
choice A and a choice B. Choice

44:41 A being you have 80
chance to lose $500. You have 20% chance to win $500.

44:50 That's pretty clear, right? That's choice A. Or
choice B, you basically

44:56 just lock in you have
100% chance to lose $280.

45:01 Let me ask you, for whoever
likes to choose choice A,

45:08 please raise your hand.

45:15 One, two, three, four. About six out of say,
let's call it 50.

45:22 So, can I ask you why you
think choice A makes sense? AUDIENCE: So, I know it's
a lower expected value,

45:27 but I enjoy gambling and I would
rather take the chance of--

45:35 JAKE XIA: Right, because you
don't want to lock in that $280 loss, right? That, or you still
have 20% chance to win.

45:41 For the ones raised
their hand for choice A, are there any other reasons?

45:48 Same reason.  AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

45:56 JAKE XIA: I assume
the rest of you would choose choice B,
unless you-- Neither? How many of you choose choice B?

46:02 Choice B. And are there
anybody think neither is right?

46:10 You have to choose. No, you have to choose.

46:16 So, either choice A or choice B. So, let me just talk a
little bit about this.

46:22 Again, I'm not trying to
tell you which one is right, but I just share my thoughts
how we look at these.

46:27 Why it called risk aversion? So, this is very
common human behavior.

46:33 When you go to the
market, you buy a stock. When the stock goes
up, makes bit of money,

46:40 the natural tendency -- for
especially someone is new to the market -- is
to let's take profit.

46:47 Let's sell. Oh, I made $1000. I made $500. Let's go have a nice
meal or whatever.

46:54 Buy an iPad. But when the stock loses money,
what's the natural tendency?

47:02 AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] JAKE XIA: That's-- AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] JAKE XIA: I think natural
tendency, lot of people

47:08 will keep it. I think if you have the
discipline to get out, that's great.

47:14 Trading is really all about
how do you risk manage, have the discipline, and
how to manage your losses.

47:22 The natural tendency
of a lot of people is, well, I think there's
a 20% chance to come back, and I'm going to make $500 more.

47:29 Why do I want to lock in
to stop myself out at 280? So even though the expected
value-- I think lot of people

47:38 said, you lose expected value,
which is $300 in choice A,

47:44 but you would still
not to choose choice B,

47:49 because you don't want
to lock in the $280 loss. Again, I'm not trying to inject
the idea to you of which one

47:57 is right or wrong,
but think about it. So, that's really the common
behavior, which mathematically

48:05 may not make sense, but lot of
people still would like to do. And also, really, when
you think about it,

48:14 depends on your situation. And let's say, you
think the market--

48:23 I'm giving you the
stock example again. If you're not purely following
the discipline of stop loss,

48:29 but you just think the
fundamental picture has changed. You really don't think the
stock should go up anymore.

48:36 Obviously, at whatever level
you should get out, regardless how much loss you lock in.

48:41 But if you think the fundamental
story is still very sound,

48:47 you should think about as if
you don't have a position, what you want to do next.

48:52 But anyway,
mathematically, I just want to see-- I
guess this is MIT,

48:59 so many people
think mathematically where you would actually
choose choice B, because that's

49:07 low expectation,
which makes sense. But I think if you
ask a larger audience,

49:12 I think a lot of people don't
really want to choose choice B, because they don't want
to lock in the loss.

49:17 Now, let me change the
question a little bit.

49:24 So, choice A becomes instead
of the 80% chance to lose, now you have 80% chance
to win $500 and 20% chance

49:34 to lose $500. Choice B, you have 100%
chance to win $280.

49:43 Who would choose choice A?  Again, minority
of this audience.

49:50 Let's say less than 10%. Who would choose choice B? The rest of you.

49:56 All right. Can someone choose choice A give
me an argument why would you?

50:04 AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

50:15 JAKE XIA: Yep. Anyone want to give me
a reason for choice B? AUDIENCE: Higher Sharpe.

50:20 JAKE XIA: Higher Sharpe? Mm-hm. Yup. Well, let me just leave it here.

50:28 Again, I think we can talk a
bit more along in the class. I mean, the last
day of the class,

50:34 hopefully we'll have much
deeper discussion on this. It's not unique.

50:39 The answer, I think it can go
you either way, as you said. If your bank account
balance is-- let's

50:47 say you are a freshman student. Your bank account is $800.

50:54 Your choice will be very
different from someone has $100,000 in his bank account.

51:01 And also, your risk tolerance,
how much you can tolerate.

51:11 I'm not going to give you
say, this is right or wrong. But with that, let me move on
and give you some homework.

51:23 So, before I give
you the homework, I want to make a
few more comments. Do people always learn
from their experiences?

51:30 In science, we collect
evidence, we build models. We first understand the physics.

51:36 We build mathematical models,
then we verify in physics, doing experiments.

51:41 But is that the same
investigation process in finance?

51:48 Market cycles are
typically very long, but people tend to
have short memories.

51:53 So, how do people really
learn from their experiences? A very interesting question. And very natural tendency
is to extrapolate

52:01 historical experience. What happened in 2008? People still remember. What happened in 1970s?

52:09 Maybe some people
still remember. What happened 100 years ago? So, people tend to extrapolate,
drawing conclusions

52:17 from very recent experience. And deterministic relationship
versus statistical relationship

52:24 is very interesting, as well. When you try to trade on those,
how do you really build models?

52:31 Is the market really efficient?  What part is efficient?

52:37 How do you really
apply those theories in your day-to-day risk
management or trading

52:43 activities? And sometimes, people
tend to oversimplify.

52:49 Just say, oh, I can model this. This is one important parameter. I just take that.

52:55 So I just give you
all the warnings that the-- again,
very young, new field

53:02 and largely, often, this
is art, than science.

53:07 So keep that in mind,
even though we're talking about mathematics in finance. Math is very powerful
and useful in finance.

53:15 So learn the math,
learn the finance first, but keep those
questions along the way

53:21 when you are learning
during this class.

53:27 So suggested homework, optional.

53:32 I mentioned a lot of
terminologies today. Go to the course website,
read what we have put up

53:39 for the financial glossary. So if you still have things
you don't understand,

53:45 compile your own list of
financial concepts, which you can search on the
web or even ask us.

53:53 But I encourage you to do that. It will prepare you well. So, that's really-- and
read other materials

53:59 on the course work. So we got maybe--
how about this? We still got about 15
minutes or 12 minutes left,

54:08 so I'll pass it to
Vasily, then maybe we can leave five minutes
for some questions. VASILY STRELA: Yeah.

54:13 JAKE XIA: Yeah, OK. VASILY STRELA:
[INAUDIBLE] mentioned that, Apple trades, that now
it's $494.4 Yeah, just a couple

54:30 of [INAUDIBLE]. Well, first of all, no offense
to people who were [INAUDIBLE],

54:42 but I just wanted to give
an example of [INAUDIBLE].

54:47 AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

55:01 VASILY STRELA: --because he
was working in our group, and it just will give you a
little bit of an idea what

55:11 we will be talking about
and what actually we do in the daily life, or what
an intern or somebody who

55:18 comes to work in this
industry could do. And one project is
[INAUDIBLE] worked

55:26 was on estimating
the noisy derivative. Derivative is called delta.

55:33 Delta is usually the first
derivative to a function. And as we will see in the class,
quite often, to obtain a price,

55:42 you do it through Monte Carlo,
meaning running a lot of paths and then averaging along them.

55:48 So, it's a statistical method. So obviously, there is a noise
to your answer every time.

55:56 So, if you want to
differentiate this functions

56:01 and get a derivative, then this
derivative will be quite noisy.

56:06 And so, instead of getting
the true derivative, you might obtain something quite
different from true derivative

56:14 just because there
is a confidence interval around any point.

56:19 And obviously, there is a
trade off here, as well, because you can run more paths,
throw more computational power,

56:28 which will reduce your
confidence interval. You will know better where
you are, more precise.

56:37 Or the other solution
could be, if you know that your function is
not too concave and reasonably

56:45 flat, you might do the
numerical differentiation

56:52 on wider interval. Basically, reducing the
significance of the error, and you will hope to arrive
to a better approximation.

57:00 So obviously, there is somewhere
balance, and the question was,

57:05 is there an optimal shift
size to get the derivative?

57:13 And that's what-- uh oh,
the slide got corrupted.

57:20 So, there was quite
a bit of mathematics involved and minimization
and optimization.

57:26 There was an answer. And that's actually what
we finally arrived at.

57:35 And that's some toy
example, but still, it shows you that if
you use constant size

57:41 and not optimal size, that would
be your numerical derivative of this blue function.

57:49 While if you use
an optimal shift size, which
[INAUDIBLE] computed, it would be much
smoother and much better.

57:57 So, that's one of example,
and that's what he did. And we actually are implementing
it in our systems and plan

58:05 to use it in practice. Another project was
actually quite different.

58:14 And it was about
electronic trading and basically how to better
predict prices of currencies

58:27 and exchange rate. And funny enough, it
was on ruble/US dollar,

58:32 because it was actually
aimed for our Moscow office.

58:38 And basically, what we had,
we had the noisy observation of broker data and
it was coming out

58:46 at different non-uniform times. Basically, at random times.

58:52 So, we decided to
use Kalman filter

58:57 and to study how it can predict. And that's one of the
nice graphs [INAUDIBLE]

59:07 produced, which again,
we will use this strategy

59:13 and the Kalman filters
which he constructed in our e-trading
platform in Moscow.

59:23 So, that's just a
couple of examples, which I wanted to give you
as a preview of what we

59:30 will be talking in the class. Just to remind, the website
is fully functional.

59:38 We put syllabus there, a
short list of literature.

59:44 We will be posting a
lot of materials there. Probably most lectures
will be published there.

59:51 Jake's slides are there already. So, any questions?

59:56 JAKE XIA: Please hand
back the sign up sheets.

60:03 We like to get your
emails so we can put you on the website for
further announcements,

60:10 but you can also add
yourselves. [INAUDIBLE]. But it's probably easier
if you put your email

60:16 on the sign up sheet,
so we can [INAUDIBLE]. VASILY STRELA: Yeah,
but please visit and sign up here,
because there will

60:23 be announcements to the class.  Thank you very much.
